## Libraries & Dependencies:

### Stack
**Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, JSX

**Back-end:** Rails, Ruby

**Database:** Postgresql

**Deployment:** Heroku & Netlify

**Testing:** Rspec-rails, Client HTTP (and dependencies below)

**Design:** Figma, Canva, Draw.io

**DevOps:** Git, Github, VS code

### Backend

- **Ruby 3.1.0:** programming language that is high-level and general purpose developed for productivity and simplicity. It is object driven. Used to build the backend API. It was particular helpful in creating models of the cuisine and food preparation categories which belong to the post model. 
  
- **Rails 7.0.4:** server side web application framework used to develop the backend api for models, controller, database structures.

- **Pg 1.1:** postgresql used as the database for Active Record. It manages the relational database. It‚Äôs reliable, scalable, free, open source and allows for data integrity and extensibility which has it‚Äôs own security features for data protection. 

- **puma 5.0:** management software that provides a powerful and secure storage system. It is the default server for Rails. 

- **Bycrypt 3.1.7:** hash algorith used for hashing passwords. This ruby gem provides a simple wrapper for safely handling passwords. 

- **Tzinfo-data:** timezone package to accompany Ruby. Used to provide timestamps on the post creation. 

- **Bootsnap:** Ruby plug in which provides a method to optimize and cache. It supports our YAML files. It reduces our booting times on the app by caching expensive computations. 

- **Activestorage:** facilitates uploading files to the cloud storage (Amazon s3 in below gem). It is the hosting service for Ruby. It also provides a disk service for testing or local deployments. 

- **Aws-sdk-s3:** web-based cloud storage service designed for online backup and archiving of data and applications on Amazon Web Services. used for file uploading images on the site when users add a new post.

- **Rack-cors:** supports the cross-origin resource sharing. Allows for web requests between domain and compatible front end app to request information from your Rails back end.. Together they make up Middleware that makes CORS-compatible Rack-framework applications. The gem will ensure the app is avoiding issues when the API is called from the frontend app. When a user clicking around on a front end app, those clicks send fetch requests to your Rails back end to perform tasks and collect data. Rack CORS allows this request to happen and gives you control over who can make requests and what kind of requests can be made.

- **Jwt:** Used for the API security to authenticate a user. The client application sends a JSON Web Token (JWT) in the authorization header of the HTTP request to the backend API. The tokens are open, standard way to represent the user's identity securely during a two-party interaction. JWT securely transmits information between parties and allows for claims or information to be transmitted in a compact and self-contained way.

- **Client HTTP Vs Code Extension:** Allows to send HTTP requests and view the response within vscode. Used to tests routing of pages, creating posts with and without tokens, and login scenarioes. 
 
### Testing in Development:

- **Debug:** debugging functionality for ruby. 

- **Rspec-rails:** Domain Specific Language testing tool used to test Ruby code. It is behavior driven that is used as a framework for unit testing

- **Factory_bot_rails:** for testing Ruby on Rails. Accompanies Rspec in that default values can be set in FactoryBot for creating, building, and pre-filling attributes for testing. 
Database_cleaner: cleans up the states in the postgresql database during tests. Easy way to turn what Rails calls ‚Äútransactional_fixtures‚Äù in non-rails ActiveRecord projects.

- **Rails-controller-testing:** assigns controller tests and assert_template to the controller and integration tests 

- **Shoulda-matchers:** assists the Rspec gem. Provides one-liners to test common functionality to save lots of coding time. Tests the associations and validations (particularly used in the post testing). 

- **Faker:** Generates fake data. Used in the seed file to create posts in the database with pre-filled dummy data. 
 
 ### Frontend

- **react ^16.13.1:** A Javascript Front-end library. Used to build the user interfaces and UI components in this application. Accompanied by the react library. 
complimentary react libraries.

- **react-dom ^16.13.1:** A complimentary library to react that binds react to the DOM. This enables methods such as render() to render components in the browser.

- **react-router-dom ^5.2.0:** To build single-page application and conditional rendering of components. It is based on the route being used in the URL. Allowed for building a SPA that acts like a site with multiple pages.

- **react-scripts 3.4.1:** A script to run build tools required to transform React and JSX syntax into plain Javascript. Used to create a custom build script for the staging environment of the application.

- **axios ^0.19.2:** Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests to the backend API. Posts and auth each use axios to make HTTP requests to each dedicated api end points on the server side. 

- **jwt-decode ^3.1.2** Decode JWT tokens, mostly useful for browser applications.

- **Web-vitals ^2.1.4:** Gem used to show how the pages perform based on real world usage data. It assists in seeing the ‚Äòpage experiences‚Äô and overall UX. Provides a way of judging whether the elements are good or poor placements. and quantifies the measurement for page speed and user interactions. 

- **Tanstack:** libraries for managing server state. It wrangles all forms of async data in React without touching any "global state". Utilities usd for complex workflows like Data Management, Data Visualization, Charts, Tables, and UI Components.

## Project Management

**Git Source Control**

Frontend: https://github.com/sofia-frugone/Gluten-Free-Finder-React/pulse
Backend: https://github.com/MeganJade5/Gluten-Free-Finder-API/pulse

**Project management tools:** Trello, Discord, Loom Videos

The project managment tool we've used to track our progress for this assesment is [Trello, which can be viewed here.](https://trello.com/b/g94algv7/t3a2-full-stack-app) We have 10 columns in our board, each of which contribute to an agile approach of product development.

1. **Blocked** Tasks which we are unable to continue with without further follow up. 
2. **Extras** Our nice-to-haves if time allows. 
3. **Need to discuss** Tasks which require more discussion.
4. **Coming Up** Tasks we will complete next sprint but need to look into before the sprint begins.
5. **To-do** Current sprint tasks.
6. **In progress** Tasks being worked on.
7. **Testing** Any tasks going through manual/user testing before being completed. 
8. **Done** Finished tasks!
9. **Questions** Similar to our discuss column however we added this board to help us visually.
10. **Resources** Any resources we want to keep during our development process. For quick reference.

### Methodology 

Our approach to this project was to separate it into sprints to tackle each aspect of its features. We chose to work in sync on features by detaching the project's backend and front end. This accommodated our working styles as each group member could work on the areas that suited their strengths. Early on, we recognised our strengths and decided that Megan was to work on the backend API, and Sofia worked on the front end. Through each sprint, we kept up regular communication via discord to understand what each person was up to and what was required for the project. This was significantly important when it came to our data calls. Our sprint planning was documented on our Trello board, where we could visually see what each of us were working on and towards each sprint. Our sprint reviews, which took place after each sprint, allowed us to work through errors, testing, and documentation. At the same time, the sprints themselves allowed us to work independently and methodically on the project. 


In phase one, we undertook market research with our client and other stakeholders to understand what the application required. This helped us determine design choices for user flow, user aesthetics, search and data storage requirements. This is also where we developed our Trello board, as we used the user stories to project manage the tasks that lay ahead effectively. Each user story outlined the functions required for both the frontend and backend sprints. Through vigorous discussion and decision-making, we were able to use the story to paint the picture of the tasks and prioritise them into the most important ones to complete first. 


In the first few days, we decided to pair-programme as starting appeared to be the most challenging, where we decided to separate the frontend and backend to suit our working styles. We wanted to solidify our skills, so we leaned on each other's strengths to help guide each other through the tough jobs. We could partake in critical and independent decision-making by splitting the project into the backend and frontend. In addition, it allowed for us to take ownership over each part of the project. Dividing the project into frontend and backend also allowed us to delegate each task and the tests. It also made merge requests easier, as we each owned a repository and never merged a PR on each other without discussion first. This ultimately reduced our merge conflicts. Once we got to the point of data calls, we switched to pair programming and worked on the project together. This may have slowed our progress, but it allowed us to step through each section of the challenges together. 


Our first two sprints allowed us to complete much of the project, allowing time to focus on working through issues (in particular data calls) and any further feature requests or suggestions from our client. We used recorded Loom videos after each sprint to effectively reduce the length of video calls and communicate to the other team members what was completed and what was still to be completed.


Each task on the Trello board was worked through according to their prioritisation. We chose not to give them due dates but to work through them progressively in a step-by-step manner. Each sprint fell through an unconventional working week - Megan worked longer weekends, whereas Sofia worked longer hours on Mondays & Tuesdays. This allowed the back end to be a few steps ahead of the front end, easing the pressure of creating data calls between the frontend and API. 


At the end of each sprint, we checked what had been completed on the Trello tasks and marked them done or moved them into the sprint backlog. This mainly occurred when we ran into problems with our data call formatting from the frontend to the back nd, which was more complex than we expected. 


### Trello
Our Trello‚Äôs were labelled with colour coding, which helped us understand each task's requirements and difficulty level quickly. 



Our labels were separated according to the following: 

- Who used the feature? User/Admin/Restaurant

- Who must undertake the task? frontend/backend/UX/UI

- What sprint? Sprint 1/2/3/4

- Priority level? Low, medium, high.
